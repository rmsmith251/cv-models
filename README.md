# cv-models

This repo is a collection of various models that I've implemented in PyTorch. The intention is for this to be for practice but I am hoping to expand this to support a variety of model types.

## Development
To get started, clone the repo with
```bash
git clone git+ssh://git@github.com/rmsmith251/cv-models
```
If you want to contribute, please install the dev requirements and install the pre-commit hooks using:
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```
